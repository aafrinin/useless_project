Project Description
Bolo Tharara is a website that precisely positions each dish on a banana leaf in the authentic way a Sadya should be served â€” just like the pros do it.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Not everyone has the time, skill, or chef-like patience to know the rules and arrange a perfect Sadya on a banana leaf.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Upload a leaf photo, and Bolo Tharara magically fills it with traditional dishes positioned perfectly! Choose your mode â€”
Mr. Ponjikkara (the generous host) or Diet Chettan (probably cuts the payasam). Because why not?
